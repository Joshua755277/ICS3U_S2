# this is a code comment
name = "Leslie"
print("Hello", name)

# Predict: 
# I think the output will print Hello Leslie

# Run:
# My prediction is correct

# Inspect:
# The output is what I expected and there was no comma in the output since it was not included in the quotation mark or string and the seperator in the print statment is a space. In order to add a comma, you would need to include a comma in the quotations of "Hello". This would look like  print("Hello,", name)

# Modify 
# this is a code comment
name = "Joshua"
print("Hello", name)
# This would print out "Hello Joshua"
# The variable name is a string that holds the entered name and is used to print Hello, t
