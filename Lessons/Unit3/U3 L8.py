1) Hypothermia
Hypothermia is defined when the body core temperature is below 35.0 Â°C in humans. In mild hypothermia, there is shivering and mental confusion. In moderate hypothermia, shivering stops and confusion increases.
2) Frostbite
Frostbite is the injury to body tissues caused by exposure to extreme cold, typically affecting the nose, fingers, or toes and sometimes resulting in gangrene.
