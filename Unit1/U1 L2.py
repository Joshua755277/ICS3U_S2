# Predict: 
# I predict the code will output 24

# Run:
# My prediction was correct and it printed out 24

# Inspect:
# The output was 24 since the number 24 was put in a print statment

# Modify:
amount = 24
print(amount)
print("Two dozen is: ", amount)
# This is an improvment since you are able to change the value it prints out when you change the number assigned to the variable "amount"

# Modify 2  
amount = 7 * 4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
# The fixed way to print a correct statement would be 
amount = 7 * 4
print("twenty-eight is: ", amount)

# Modify 3
amount = 8
amount = amount + 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
# First it is setting the variable amount to 8 then in the next line it is adding 1 to amount making it 8 + 1 which is equal to 9
amount = 8
amount += 1 
print("The amount is: ", amount)
# amount += 1 is the same as amount = amount + 1

# Modify 4
amount = 8
amount = amount * 2
print(amount)
# amount = amount * 2 would take the value of amount and double it since you are mulitplying by 2
amount = 8
amount *= 2
print(amount)
