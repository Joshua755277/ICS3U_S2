# Task A
# I think that it will output:
# Welcome to Sanjay's Koala Party!
# It's possible Sanjay can distribute  12
#  cookies for each bowl.
# My prediction was correct 
# I fixed the program to only print one space after the word distribute by removing the space after the word distribute within the quotation marks

# Task B
print("Sanjay has", 6, "bowls for", 144, "cookies")

# Task C
print("The number of cookies per bowl is", 12*12)
# There is one text value and one number value (the 2 number values are being multipled together with * operation)
